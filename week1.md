Positives:
Pairing - being able to discuss and work together on a project makes it seem less of an insurmountable challenge and more of an achievable goal. Pooling my knowledge with someone else's has definitely helped me learn a lot in a relatively short space of time.

System - having so many levels of help available means that no position is a complete dead end. Asking a pair partner, another junior, one of the seniors, etc is a good way to get past a problem, and being asked to explain something helps cement their understanding too.

Issues:
Git commits - need to be much more consistent with git commits, as often as possible after changing my code. Had an issue where I tried to add some new code which caused some of my earlier spec tests to fail and it took quite a while to get back to where I'd been - if I'd had a commit there I could have just reverted to that in seconds.

Remembering syntax - even when I'm fairly sure I know the syntax for a particular command I'll end up looking it up just in case, whereas if I trusted my knowledge and tried to get it to work first time I'd save myself a lot of time.

Next week:
Ask more questions - if someone mentions something I don't understand 100% I should be asking questions about it instead of keeping quiet and just nodding along. It helps us both so there's really no downside.

Structure - be better with driver/navigator changeovers and also with breaks during sessions. This should stop me from relying overly on my partner (or vice versa) and also help me keep my concentration up throughout the day.

Other - only one week in and already the communal spirit between the cohort is very strong - throwing us all together and giving us a challenge to work at has definitely fostered a very strong sense of togetherness. I can see why people say you end up seeing your cohort almost as family.
